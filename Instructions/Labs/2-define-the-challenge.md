## Step 2: Define the Challenge

**Suggested time:** 10 minutes  

As a team, **identify and agree on one common challenge** to focus on for the rest of the Frontier Hack Event. This could be something simple, like scheduling meetings, or something complex — for example, processes tied to multiple systems, sensitive data, or compliance requirements. The goal is to spark conversation about what’s working, what’s not, and where AI might play a role.

You'll complete the following tasks:

- Explore challenges or opportunities in your work environment  
- Prioritize them against business priorities  
- Select one challenge to carry forward as your problem statement  

> **Note:** Complete all tasks in this step before moving forward. Sample prompts are just a starting point — adapt or create your own, and refine until Copilot delivers the results you need.

> **Reminder:** Balance team discussion with Copilot insights — neither replaces the other. Use Copilot to surface ideas, then discuss as a team to decide what resonates most.

### Task 1: Explore Challenges or Opportunities  

Each team member will start by using **Copilot Chat** to identify common challenges in their day-to-day work.  

**Steps:**  
- Open a new browser tab and navigate to <a href="https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat" target="_blank">m365.cloud.microsoft/chat</a>  
- Ensure the **Work mode** tab is selected in Copilot Chat:

  **Sample Prompt:**  

    ```text
    I’m investigating common day-to-day issues I face at work, such as processes, collaboration, or time management. Look at recent conversations from my Teams chats and emails related to [your role focus, i.e., content development, technical training, program management]. Summarize the key issues or pain points mentioned in the last 6 months and limit the output to the top 3 most relevant issues only. Show the results in a table with: 
     
    - Title: Short label for the issue  
    - Problem Statement: Write each as a clear and concise statement of the challenge  
    - Frequency: How often it comes up (e.g., number of mentions) 
    ```  

  > **Note:** Replace the text within brackets with your specific role focus (e.g., program management).  

  > **Tip:**
  >
  > - You can ask Copilot to output the full table directly into a Word document for easier sharing and formatting.
  >
  > -  For extra help writing or refining prompts, try <a href="https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200007578" target="_blank">Prompt Coach</a>.

### Task 2: Prioritize Against Business  

Review the problem statements Copilot surfaced in Task 1. Then, run them back through Copilot to align with organizational priorities.

Run the following sample prompt in the **same Copilot Chat window from task 1**.

**Sample Prompt:**

```text
Which of these issues is most worth exploring further, when aligned to organizational priorities set by /[name of org leader or manager]?  
```

> **Note:** Use the **/** reference feature in Copilot Chat to tag the leader or manager by name.

---

### Task 3: Select Your Problem Statement

As a team, choose **one challenge or opportunity** to carry forward. Capture it clearly and simply — this will be your problem statement for the rest of the Frontier Hack Event.  

> **Tip:** If you’d like, you can use Copilot to refine the wording of your chosen statement for clarity or impact.

---

## Your Output  

**Section:** Problem or opportunity statement

In the provided Hack Event Template, fill in the **Problem or opportunity statement** section. Summarize the single challenge or opportunity your team agreed on as a clear, concise statement.

## Notes

TIPS:
Time crunch, time crunch, time crunch

Step is about identifying multiple challenges either via discussions or Copilot (latter is recommended) and selecting one challenge to focus on and draft problem statement

Point them to the sample prompt (will help with time crunch)

Selecting one challenge: Ask Copilot to prioritize using greatest impact criteria, that is, which would have the greatest impact if solved.

Step Output (for selected challenge): PROBLEM STATEMENT
