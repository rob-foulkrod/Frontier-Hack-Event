## Step 1: Kickoff & Team Formation

**Suggested time:** 10 minutes

You'll start the Frontier Hack Event  by meeting your team members and Table Coach. This is your chance to build rapport and set the tone for how you’ll collaborate during the rest of the session. By the end, your team should feel comfortable working together and ready to dive into problem-solving.  

You'll complete the following tasks:  

- Introduce yourself to your team members and identify your Table Coach  
- Come up with a team name  
- Create a Team Worksheet  
- Set your team’s collaboration style  

> **Note:** please complete all the tasks in this step before moving forward

### Task 1: Team Introductions & Identify Your Table Coach  

Take 5 minutes to meet your fellow team members and confirm who your Table Coach is.

Share:  

- **Your Name**  
- **Your Role**  
- **The first word that comes to mind when you think about AI**

### Task 2: Create a Team Name  

Work together to come up with a team name that represents your group. Keep it fun, creative, or tied to your focus area.  

### Task 3: Download your Teams Hack Event Template

Throughout the Frontier Hack Event, you’ll be capturing notes and outputs from each step.  

To keep your team’s ideas organized - and to ensure your final submission is complete - use the provided **Hack Event Template**.  

Have one person from your team:  

- Open the <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/Frontier-Hack-Event/raw/refs/heads/master/Resourcefiles/HackEventTemplate.docx" target="_blank">Hack Event Template</a>.
- Download the template—it should now appear in your 'Downloads' folder.
- Open the file and **enable editing** if prompted.  

Optionally, to make collaboration easier:  

- In the top-right corner, select **Share** > **Share...**.  
- If prompted *“Please upload your document to share it”*, choose your Microsoft OneDrive account.  
- In the new window that appears, select **Copy link** and share it with your teammates.  

### Task 4: Collaboration (Optional)  

If helpful, assign roles to structure your collaboration. Multiple people can share the same role, or you may skip this step if your team prefers to stay fluid.  

**Suggested roles:**  

- **Problem Compiler:** Collects and organizes challenges into a list.  
- **Prompt Runners:** Operates Copilot on behalf of the team (we suggest at least 2 people running prompts).  
- **Note Taker:** Captures key ideas and drafts the problem statement.  
- **Time Keeper:** Keeps the team on track with the schedule.

Consider starting a Teams group chat with your teammates to make it easier to share prompt results later.

## Your Output  

**Section:** Team Name & Table Number  

In the provided Hack Event Template, fill in the sections for **Team Name** and **Table Number**.
