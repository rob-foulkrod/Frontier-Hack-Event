## Step 3: Break Down the Problem  

**Suggested time:** 10 minutes  

Now that your team has agreed on a problem statement, the next step is to dig deeper. The goal is to map out the pain points, inefficiencies, and root causes that make this problem worth solving.  

You'll complete the following tasks:

- Map pain points and inefficiencies  
- Use Copilot to expand on causes, impacts, and related discussions  

> **Note:** Complete all tasks in this step before moving forward. Sample prompts are just a starting point — adapt or create your own, and refine until Copilot delivers the results you need.

### Task 1: Map Pain Points  

As a team, discuss and document where the current process breaks down. Focus on:

- Manual tasks  
- Bottlenecks  
- Data gaps  
- Sources of frustration  

If your problem feels broad, think about its smaller parts — which steps or areas contribute most, and which might be quick wins?  

> **Optional:** You can also consider impact metrics like lost time, extra cost, or reduced quality. This can help Copilot (and your team) better frame the problem.  

---

### Task 2: Explore with Copilot  

Once you’ve listed your pain points, use **Copilot Chat** to expand your understanding:  

- *What are the likely root causes?*
- *What impacts does this issue have on people, workflows, or outcomes?*
- *Have any related suggestions or discussions surfaced in the past six months?*

**Sample Prompt:**  

```text
Explore the issue of [Insert Problem Statement Here]. Look for factors that contribute to this problem, its impact on people or workflows, and any related discussions or suggestions raised in the past six months. Summarize your findings in a simple table with three columns: Insight Type (Cause, Impact, or Suggestion), Description, and Source.  
```

  > **Tip:** You can ask Copilot to output the full table directly into a Word document for easier sharing and formatting.

---

## Your Output  

**Section:** Pain Points & Inefficiencies  

In the provided Hack Event Template, fill in the **Pain Points & Inefficiencies** section. Summarize the main breakdowns your team identified, along with any root causes, impacts, or suggestions surfaced with Copilot.

## Notes
TIPS:
Time crunch, time crunch, time crunch!

Step is about identifying multiple challenges either via discussions or Copilot and selecting one challenge to focus on and draft problem statement

Point team to the sample prompt (will help with time crunch)

Reminder: Not building a technical agent or solutioning here

Selecting one challenge: Ask Copilot to prioritize using greatest impact criteria, that is, which would have the greatest impact if solved.
