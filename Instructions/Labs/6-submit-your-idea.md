## Step 6: Submit Your Idea

**Suggested time:** 10 minutes  

In this final step, your team will bring everything together and submit your idea for judging.

You'll complete the following Tasks:  

- Summarize Your Solution and Key Insights  
- *(Optional)* Create a logo or image for your solution  
- Submit your idea for judging  

> **Note:** Complete all tasks in this step before moving forward. Sample prompts are just a starting point — adapt or create your own, and refine until Copilot delivers the results you need.

### Task 1: Summarize Your Solution and Key Insights  

In the provided Hack Event Template, fill in the **Short Summary & Key Insights** section. Summarize the solution your team selected and make note of any key insights you’d like documented. This is your team’s **final required output**. *If your solution doesn’t have a name yet, take a moment to create one now - we will reference it later*.

> **Tip:** Use Copilot in Word to help generate a polished summary. Start with a brief overview of the solution, then highlight any unique aspects or important considerations.  

---

### *(Optional Task)* Create an Image  

If time allows, use **Creator** to design a simple image or logo for your solution.  

**Steps:**  

- Navigate to <a href="https://m365.cloud.microsoft/create" target="_blank">m365.cloud.microsoft/create</a>  
- Select **Create an image**  
- Enter your prompt where it says *“Describe your image”*  

    **Sample Prompt:**

    ```text
    Create a simple and modern logo for a solution named [Solution Name] that targets [target audience/industry]. The logo should convey [desired qualities, e.g., innovation, reliability].
    ```

    > Replace the bracketed text with your team’s choices.  

- Choose a style, brand color, and size  
- Select **Create**

### Task 2: Submit Your Idea  

Once your Frontier Hack Event Template is complete, submit your team’s idea for judging.  

> **Note:** Your Table Coach can confirm how submissions will be collected if there are any questions.  

- Navigate to the <a href="https://microsoftapc.sharepoint.com/teams/SyncWeekHack/_layouts/15/listforms.aspx?cid=NmEzYTBhM2MtODNhMi00M2IwLTk5ZGQtZmYzMGZiMTQyYTdi&nav=YjJlZjI3MWItODgxNy00NmE1LTliNzItOWJmMjJkOTY2NTZh" target="_blank">Idea Submission Form</a>.

  - Solution idea title

  - Short Summary & Key Insights → Copy from Hack Event Template
  - Problem or Opportunity Statement → Copy from Hack Event Template
