## Step 4: Explore AI Solutions  

**Suggested time:** 20 minutes  

Now that you’ve mapped the pain points around your chosen problem, it’s time to explore possible solutions. The goal is to use Copilot to surface ideas, review them together, and decide on the best option to carry forward.  

You'll complete the following tasks:  

- Use **Researcher** to generate solution ideas  
- Review and discuss the output as a group  
- Select the most promising solution(s)

> **Note:** Complete all tasks in this step before moving forward. Sample prompts are just a starting point — adapt or create your own, and refine until Copilot delivers the results you need.

### Task 1: Use Researcher to Gather Ideas  

Pick one teammate to run a query in **Researcher**. Researcher can take several minutes to complete. While it’s running, the rest of the team can start brainstorming possible solution approaches on their own — what tools, automations, or AI capabilities might help? Later, you’ll compare these ideas against the Researcher output in the next task.

> **Tip:** For those not running Researcher, try <a href="https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/?titleId=P_be483bea-dc19-b6ae-1d69-fde1f2c7b661" target="_blank">Idea Coach</a><br> as a brainstorming companion. It’s designed to spark creativity and can help keep your discussion focused while you wait.

**Steps (For Researcher):**

- Open a new browser tab and navigate to <a href="https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat" target="_blank">m365.cloud.microsoft/chat</a>
- In the M365 Copilot menu, expand **Agents** and select **Researcher**

    **Sample Prompt:**  

    ```text
    Propose AI-powered solutions to directly address this problem: [Inset problem statement]
     
    1. Start with three bullet points summarizing the most relevant challenges or pain points that make this problem worth solving.  
    2. Suggest up to three specific AI solutions. For each, include:  
       - Solution Name (be specific, e.g., “Copilot Studio Agent that auto-flags duplicate course files”)  
       - How it would work to solve this problem in practice  
       - Key Benefits for the team or organization  
    3. Conclude with one clear recommendation: which single solution is most promising, and why it stands out over the others.  
    ```  

> **Note:** Researcher may request additional context to help refine its output before providing a final response.

### Task 2: Review & Decide  

As a team:  

- Review the three summary bullets and solution from Researcher  
- React to its recommendation — do you agree, or would you choose differently?  
- Capture **two or three final approach options**, marking the one you’ll carry forward  

> **Tip:** If your chosen solution could evolve into an agent, the <a href="https://aka.ms/2025jul-agentideation-engage" target="_blank">Copilot Agent Ideation Partner</a> can help you shape that idea.

## Your Output  

**Section:** Approach Options  

In the provided Hack Event Template, fill in the **Approach Options** section. Summarize the solutions you reviewed, including the one your team selected to carry forward.
