## Step 4: Explore AI Solutions  

**Suggested time:** 20 minutes  

Now that you’ve mapped the pain points around your chosen problem, it’s time to explore possible solutions. The goal is to use Copilot to surface ideas, review them together, and decide on the best option to carry forward.  

You'll complete the following tasks:  

- Use **Researcher** to generate solution ideas  
- Review and discuss the output as a group  
- Select the most promising solution(s)

> **Note:** Complete all tasks in this step before moving forward. Sample prompts are just a starting point — adapt or create your own, and refine until Copilot delivers the results you need.

### Task 1: Use Researcher to Gather Ideas  

Pick one teammate to run a query in **Researcher**. Researcher can take several minutes to complete. While it’s running, the rest of the team can start brainstorming possible solution approaches on their own — what tools, automations, or AI capabilities might help? Later, you’ll compare these ideas against the Researcher output in the next task.

> **Tip:** For those not running Researcher, try <a href="https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/?titleId=P_be483bea-dc19-b6ae-1d69-fde1f2c7b661" target="_blank">Idea Coach</a><br> as a brainstorming companion. It’s designed to spark creativity and can help keep your discussion focused while you wait.

**Steps (For Researcher):**

- Open a new browser tab and navigate to <a href="https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat" target="_blank">m365.cloud.microsoft/chat</a>
- In the M365 Copilot menu, expand **Agents** and select **Researcher**

    **Sample Prompt:**  

    ```text
    Propose AI-powered solutions to directly address this problem: [Inset problem statement]
     
    1. Start with three bullet points summarizing the most relevant challenges or pain points that make this problem worth solving.  
    2. Suggest up to three specific AI solutions. For each, include:  
       - Solution Name (be specific, e.g., “Copilot Studio Agent that auto-flags duplicate course files”)  
       - How it would work to solve this problem in practice  
       - Key Benefits for the team or organization  
    3. Conclude with one clear recommendation: which single solution is most promising, and why it stands out over the others.  
    ```  

> **Note:** Researcher may ask for additional context to refine its output before completing a response. Please keep an eye out and provide input if prompted.

### Task 2: Review & Decide  

As a team:  

- Review the three summary bullets and the solution from Researcher, as well as any other solution ideas your team developed during your discussion. 
- React to its recommendation — do you agree, or would you choose differently?  
- Capture **two or three final approach options**, marking the one you’ll carry forward  

---

## Your Output  

**Section:** Approach Options  

In the provided Hack Event Template, fill in the **Approach Options** section. Summarize the solutions you reviewed, including the one your team selected to carry forward.

## Notes
TIPS:

Suggest using both Copilot Standard and Researcher (call out the additional time for Researcher). If team using only Researcher, members might be left “twiddling the thrums” while waiting for Researcher’s response.

Watch Researcher progress – might require clarification and is waiting

Reminder: Not building a technical agent or solutioning here

Hi Coaches. Since everyone will be using the Researcher Agent, I want to share some helpful tips for your tables. 
1 - Advise users to be specific in their prompts; Researcher is mainly connected to GRAPH and will search user documents first, then documents shared with the user, and finally any document the user can access. If users want to search outside the organization, they should specify "Use only reputable web sources and ignore internal content". 
2 - Instead of copying results from Copilot, it's best for your teams to call the Researcher in the prompt area by clicking the Researcher icon or using the "@" symbol. This approach ensures smoother and more concise research by including the existing context. If you already use these techniques, that's great. If you need help, please let me know.
