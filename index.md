Welcome to the **WWL Frontier Hack Event**!  

This Hack Event  is about exploring how AI can help us tackle real challenges at work.  

You’ll collaborate with your team to define a problem, brainstorm solutions, and craft a solution — with the help of your Table Coach and AI.  

> **Goal:** Accelerate alignment on the *Frontier Firm* concept and generate **AI-driven problem statements and solution ideas**.  
> This is not about building a technical agent — it’s about framing challenges, ideating, and shaping solutions.
